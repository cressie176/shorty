## Remove .gitkeep files when they are no longer needed

- .gitkeep files are placeholders to preserve empty directories in git
- When you add actual files to a directory containing a .gitkeep, remove the .gitkeep file
- Example: After adding a file to an empty directory, delete the .gitkeep in that directory
